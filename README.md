# covid-19-stats-statewise(INDIA)
This python script will display triple bar chart for covid 19 cases among different States and Union Territories of India. If you don't find any data for particular
states then it will be because the data was not present on the api used in the script. 
The API link - http://covid19-india-adhikansh.herokuapp.com/states


The API doesnt work anymore.
